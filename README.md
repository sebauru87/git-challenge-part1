# Git challenge

## Part 1

Let's put into practice everything learned in this lesson by working on a practical example.

1.  Fork this repository

2.  Create a new branch "feature-a"

    a. Create a commit updating the user's personal data with your own data (name, country, studies, etc). Push this commit.

    b. Change the header left icons for text links. Don't commit.

3.  While you were working on the previous change, you are asked to immediately work on something else, so you need to leave your work in progress for later. This code isn't ready to be committed yet, so you want to **stash** it.

4.  Create another branch from main named "feature-b"

    a. Create a commit updating the hero background image.

    b. Create another commit updating the user name.

    c. Create another commit updating the text of the footer.

    d. Push all previous commits

5.  Merge "feature-b" into main. While you were working on your branch, other devs may have merged their work into the main branch, so before merging your code, you should try to get the latest version.

    a. What commands would you use and why?
    -git pull origin main
    -git rebase main

    b. What merge method would you use and why?
    -git checkout main
    -git merge feature-b

6.  Now you want to go back to continue with the code stashed in step 3.

    a. Before getting back to your previous work, update your branch

    b. What merge method would you use and why?
    -git checkout feature-a
    -git rebase main

    c. Conflicts happened? Solve them and prefer your code.
    Yes

    d. Commit and push your previously stashed changes

7.  Create a PR in order to merge feature-a into main.
